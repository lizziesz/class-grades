# ClassGrades

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1.4.

This project allows a user to enter student names and test scores, and generates a simple test summary of the min, max, and average scores. It allows for editing of the class list.

This is a just a front end project, and there is no persistent data store or service. It uses NgRx for state management.

## Quick Start

`npm install`
`npm start`
navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. If you run `ng serve --open`, localhost:4200 will be opened for you. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Ideas for Improvement

With more time, more styling and tests could be added. In addition, adding an actual service layer and persistent data storage (if a teacher wanted to save a class list) would be another way to improve the application.
